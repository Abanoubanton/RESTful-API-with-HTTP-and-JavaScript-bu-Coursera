# RESTful-API-with-HTTP-and-JavaScript-by-Coursera
In this project you will take advantage of a search engine application interface created by a third party developer and create a useful recipe search engine web page that you can either use on your own computer or host it on the web to show to friends.

By the end of the project, you will understand the principles of REST, API and write code in JavaScript to interface with other systems in web pages.
